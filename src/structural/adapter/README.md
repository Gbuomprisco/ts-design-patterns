# Adapter

The Adapter pattern is used to be an adapter/bridge between classes.
The intent is:

- to convert an interface to another expected interface so that a certain class can use it
- let classes with different interfaces work together
- not to change your existing classes, but add an adapter so that the classes remain the same
